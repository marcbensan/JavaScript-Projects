It provides practical experience in solving real-world problems related to date, time, and string processing.

**Data Manipulation** - the goal of this project is to improve my proficiency in JavaScript programming, especially when dealing with real-world data structures commonly encountered in web development projects. It also helps them understand how to work with external data sources, handle errors, and ensure the correctness of their code through testing.
